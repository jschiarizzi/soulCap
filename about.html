 <p>SoulCap is an AR platform where you can tokenize, buy and sell souls. Later on, we'll also add the ability to play interact with (and/or torture ðŸ˜ˆ) souls. We made this proof of concept for the 0x hackathon to get started.
<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to help people tokenize their creativity in a new way, and have a little fun as well. Over the long term, we're also highly interested in game interopability, and hope to partner with other games to make Souls an avatar standard. 
<br/>
<br/>
We are big fans of 0x, and also had an interest in experimenting with new token mechanics for ZRX, so we offer a discount for minting souls if the user holds ZRX in their wallet.
<br/>
<br/>
The way it works is pretty simple. The user goes to our site, and can browse the various souls we have to offer--they take picture of themselves, and "entomb" this picture into a "soul" as an ERC721 for a small fee (.005 Eth, .0025 if the user holds ZRX in their wallet).
<br/>
 <br/>
 Users can then visit our store to buy "showcase" souls.
